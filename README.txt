INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The BeaconPack repository is to maintain and host a simplistic SMS 
response system that provides information to a user. Examples of 
information are news articles, informational articles, excerpts
for a specific set of information, etc. The system was designed based 
on a STEM research and social benefit conference for the purposes of 
bringing remote locations in third world countries closer to recent 
information and news. 

The system is compiled of three components: SMS processing file, 
a parser for information, and helpers for various remedial tasks
(user_input_processor.php; rss_parser.php; connection_helper.php, as
an example). These files are designed to work with the cell service 
Tropo, but can be used with other services provided that the files are
in the service's recommended language.

REQUIREMENTS

TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * If a phone uses a wireless connection to send messages please try 
   the following:
 
   - Please disable that portion of message sending considering Tropo
     is designed for SMS and not message sending protocols like 
	 iMessage. 

 * More to come based on bugs and their error reports


FAQ
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 * None until a proper user base and reports have been submitted
